# Unity Enemy FSM (Idle / Patrol / Chase)

A simple Finite State Machine (FSM) for an enemy AI made in Unity with three basic core behaviors:
- **Idle** - Enemy waits/looks around
- **Patrol** - Enemy moves between transforms/waypoints
- **Chase** - Enemy follows player when detected

This project is meant to be easy to read, easy to extend, and a good foundation for more states
